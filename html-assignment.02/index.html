        <p>
            My name is Daria, and I am
             18 years old. I was born on December 11<sup>th</sup> in a small town of Russia. Now I've been living for 1 month in Ottawa. I am a first-year student at Algonquin College studying <strong>interactive media design</strong>. I am passionate about creating new arts and designs, especially when it comes to websites and posters.

            In my free time, I enjoy <em>listening to music</em> as music allows me to immerse myself  in different melodies and rhythms. I am also interested in <em>taking photos</em> of nature, buildings, landscapes, food, and people. Photography helps me capture special moments and express my creativity through visual storytelling. In addition, <em>exploring new places</em>, whether it's my hometown or completely new place, brings me joy and fulfillment to life.
